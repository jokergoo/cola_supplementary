This document contains results for testing the number of samplings for consensus partitioning on the two
datasets ( [TCGA GBM microarray dataset](https://jokergoo.github.io/cola_examples/TCGA_GBM) and 
[HSMM single cell RNASeq dataset](https://jokergoo.github.io/cola_examples/HSMM_single_cell)).
The numbers of random samplings were tested for 25, 50, 100 and 200. We tested both row sampling and column
sampling. For each combination of parameters, **cola** ran for 100 times. The scripts for the analysis can be found
[here](https://github.com/jokergoo/cola_manuscript/tree/master/test_nrep).

For each dataset, there are four plots:

- Scatter plots showing the variability of the consensus partitioning metrics. Three metrics
(1-PAC, mean silhouette and the concordance scores) are tested.
- Line plots showing the mean concordance between the 100 **cola** runs.
- Barplots showing the mean concordance of the consensus parititons between 25 samplings and 200 samplings.
- Scatter plots showing the relation between 1-PAC under 25/200 samplings and the concordance.
